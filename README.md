# starting-point

This is a starting point for a react web app.

##Download the starting-point into your project:

Create a file folder on your local machine and ```git init ```

```git remote add start https://github.com/dkatz93/starting-point/```
```git fetch start```
```git merge start/master```

##All you have to do before coding is:

Change the database name from START in ```db/index.js``` and run ```createdb``` in the command line with the same database name to create the database on your computer

After that, run ```npm install``` to get all of the dependencies then run ```npm start```
